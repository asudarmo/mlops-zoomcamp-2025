# <center>MLOps Zoomcamp 2025 Learning in Public</center>

This Github page will document my learning journey, which I will update as I go along in the course

### Module 1 (12-19 May 2025)

In the introduction week, we learn about what MLOps and and why it is important. We did a simple regression exercise, predicting trip duration on [NYC TLC Trip](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

### Module 2 (19-26 May 2025)

In the second week, we learn the fundamentals of experiment tracking and model lifecycle management using MLflow:

- We installed MLflow and launched the tracking server locally.
- We tuned model hyperparameters using hyperopt
- We logged parameters, metrics and artifacts both manually and via the autologging feature.
- We viewed the saved experiments using the MLflow UI
- We promoted the best model to MLflow model registry

### Module 3 (27 May - 10 June 2025)
